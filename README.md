# Getting Started
***

Jekyll is a Ruby gem that relies on the installation of Ruby and a Ruby version manager (such as [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby)). See the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/) 
for further detail.

## Quick Setup
1. Install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install rbenv`
2. Install [Bundler](https://bundler.io/): `bundler install`
3. Navigate to the publishing source of the site: `cd docs`
4. Run `bundle install`

## Running the Site locally

1. Build and preview: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
2. To preview your site, in your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:4000.
