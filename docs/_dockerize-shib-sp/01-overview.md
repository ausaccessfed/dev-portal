This tutorial will guide you through how to create a Docker image for a Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) application and configure it to run in a container. This provides an alternative to the [previous SAML integration tutorial](http://127.0.0.1:4000/saml-integration/01-overview), which may be useful if you are using a MacOS as opposed to a Windows or Linux machine.

### What you'll learn

- Create a Docker file for building a Docker image
- Use a base image for your Dockerfile
- Install and configure Shibboleth
- Build a Docker image based on the Dockerfile and run the container
- Test and deploy the dockerized SP

### What you'll need

- Docker container platform
- Knowledge running a container platform in a local development environment
