The AAF Rapid Connect service allows the AAF to translate SAML assertions which are verified by a standard Shibboleth SP into JSON Web Token (JWT) which is more suitable for use by services with restricted environments or services with no need to access some of the more advanced parts of the AAF offering.

This tutorial describes JWT for developers and the integration code required to use AAF Rapid Connect with your 
applications.

### What you'll learn
