This tutorial shows how to register a new OpenID Connect service with the AAF Test Federation

### What you'll learn

- How to connect an OpenID Connect service

### What you'll need

- Sufficient experience in undertaking OIDC integration work to create your own Relying Party (RP) components with minimal help from the AAF technical team. 
- There are several open-source libraries which implement most of the RP requirements in several languages, [GitHub](https://github.com) is an excellent resource, as is the [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/developers/libraries/). 


The AAF *does not* offer support or advice in this area, and the choice depends on the subscriberâ€™s strengths and existing knowledge of OIDC integration.
