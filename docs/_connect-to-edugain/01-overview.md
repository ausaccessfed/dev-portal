## What is eduGAIN?

[eduGAIN](https://edugain.org) (Education Global Authentication Infrastructure) is an international service connecting research communities and higher education identity federations around the world.

Using simple, secure single sign-on access, eduGAIN enables researchers, educators and students in one country to collaborate with their colleagues and access applications, tools and datasets in other countries. 

The Australian Access Federation is now connected to eduGAIN and Service Providers can open their services to international researchers if desired. 

AAF subscribers can now access services from more than 40 similar federations including the United States and most European countries.

By connecting to eduGAIN, your service will benefit from:

- exposure to international end-users who can access your service(s) via other international federations
- simplified and secure information exchange for access and authentication
- international research collaboration
- simple and secure access for researchers, removing the need for direct integration with applications in other federations.
