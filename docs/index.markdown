## Overview

The Australian Access Federation provides two Federations, a Test Federation and a Production Federation.

### Test Federation

The test federation is open to anyone and there is no cost involved. Anyone can use the test environment for developing and testing their integrations.

### Production Federation

To participate in the production federation you must subscribe to the federation. Details on how to do this are available here:https://aaf.edu.au/subscribe/who.html
