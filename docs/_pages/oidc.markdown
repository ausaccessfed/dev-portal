# Documentation
## Overview

The **AAF** supports **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** connectivity and operates an OpenID Provider (OP) which authenticates 
users who have an account at any **AAF** subscriber **Identity Provider (IdP)**. This service is a production choice 
available to AAF subscribers to connect their OIDC services to the Federation. This is an maturing service and at 
this stage only supports a subset of attributes/claims (**for attribute requirements outside this range, please 
contact us to discuss**).

To get started, visit

-  [Our test federation](https://manager.test.aaf.edu.au/oidc)

-  [Our production federation](https://manager.aaf.edu.au/oidc)

## Attributes / Claims


These are the attributes/claims Central can provide to an RP currently:

## Details

Before registering an **OIDC** service, deployers must have sufficient experience in undertaking *OIDC* integration 
work 
to create their own **Relying Party (RP)** components with minimal help from the AAF technical team. There are several 
open-source libraries which implement most of the RP requirements in several languages, [GitHub](https://github.com) 
is an excellent 
resource, as is the [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/developers/libraries/). The AAF does not offer support or 
advice in this area, and the choice depends on the subscriberâ€™s strengths and existing knowledge of OIDC integration.


The **AAF OP** satisfies the **OIDC** conformance testing framework and passes the Authorization Code flow. The **AAF** 
monitors the **OP** during business hours and responds to service interruption issues promptly.

To register a new **OIDC RP** please visit:

[AAF Production environment](https://manager.aaf.edu.au/oidc/clients/new){: .btn .btn-blue .text-center }

[AAF Test environment](https://manager.test.aaf.edu.au/oidc/clients/new){: .btn .btn-blue .text-center }

and select the **Register a New Service**. The following information is required:

1. Client Name - a descriptive name for the service.
2. Description -a meaningful description to help users of this service understand its purpose 
3. Organisation - responsible for the operation of the service, must be an AAF subscriber.
4. Redirect URL - The endpoint which will receive the OIDC responses from AAF. Additional redirect URIs can be added after registration via the client details page.


Click the **Resister Service** to complete the registration step.


Next you will be provided the Client ID and Secret used by your **RP** service that is generated during the registration process.

> {: .highlight }
Note: You only have one opportunity to copy the Secret, it cannot be recovered later. You can however generate a new secret later.

Verify the details are correct, then hit the Active button.

    In the test federation your service will be available to use immediately
    In production, the service MUST be approved by your organisation and the AAF before it will be available for use.
