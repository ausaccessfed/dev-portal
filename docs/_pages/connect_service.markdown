# Getting Started

## Login to Federation Manager

This section will show you how to authenticate to the AAF Federation Manager Dashboard (test or production) to register a new service.

You will need AAF login credentials to register a new service in Federation Manager.

The AAF login credentials are generally the same as what you use for an associated Australian university or research
institution.

You can check the list of subscribers from the [AAF website](https://aaf.edu.au/subscribers/) to see whether your organisation is AAF enabled.

If your organisation is not AAF enabled, please visit [AAF Support](https://support.aaf.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/19000036105-how-to-join-the-australian-access-federation) for information on how to
join or [contact us](mailto:support@aaf.edu.au), and we'll set you up.
