<h3 class="text-warning">What software are you running?</h3>

There are a number of software implementations of the SAML service provider. Each will have its own website, development activities and update notification processes. You should be following the notifications for the software you are using to implement your SAML service providers to help ensure you are running the latest secure stable version at all times. The following table provides a short list of common software that has been used within the AAF.

<h3 class="text-warning">Which version are you running?</h3>

To determine the software or System Information/version you are currently running, type one of the following commands:

Note: Depending on your software version, these commands/keys may vary.


#### Shibboleth SP

You can determine the overall version of the SP software you have installed by running shibd from the command line with the -v option (Linux/Unix only).

`shibd -v`


On Windows, use:

`shibd -version`

If the shibboleth SP isn't in your path and you get the `'unrecognised command'` error, you might have to browse to the folder, usually `c:\opt\shibboleth-sp\sbin`.


For any platform, you can determine the version of the SP and various libraries by examining log files during the
startup sequence or, if you have sufficient access, by using the <a href="https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SP3/pages/2065334870/Status+Handler">status handler</a>.


#### SimpleSAMLphp

To determine the version you are currently running:


SimpleSAML_Configuration-class:

```shell
require_once('.../lib/_autoload.php');

$cfg = SimpleSAML_Configuration::loadFromArray(array());

echo $cfg->getVersion();
```

Output can be something like:

`1.14.14`

<h3 class="text-warning">Upgrading your software</h3>

Consult the software web site for detailed information on upgrading. Upgrading the Shibboleth SP software is generally straight forward as it packaged software on a number of Linux variants.


When upgrading please ensure you upgrade your test version in the AAF test federation before moving to your production services. Also consider your organisation change processes when upgrading software.

<h3 class="text-warning">Keeping your OS and supporting software up to date</h3>

You SAML Service provider software doesnâ€™t run in isolation, there is the Operating System, Web Server, crypto software and many other dependent software components. Each of these is specific to your environments and each will have its own maintenance processes. You need to ensure that these supporting components are regularly patched and upgraded.
