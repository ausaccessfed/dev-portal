* If you are using Moodle for the first time, [please refer to their documentation](https://moodledev.io/general/development/gettingstarted#a-quick-start-to-moodle-development) to get started.
* Otherwise, if you are already using Moodle on a container platform like Docker-Desktop, start your Moodle container (e.g. `bin/moodle-docker-compose up -d`). 
* In a local development environment, navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
* Once you are signed in as the admin user, click on 'Site administration' at the top of the page.
