VerifID is a service that allows staff and students from qualifying institutions to receive discounts at various retailers. VerifID works by verifying that a User belonging to an Organisation has a certain desired Affiliation with the institution.

The VerifID service will:

- Provide an API for a Subscriber’s Client to interact with. The API will enable the verification workflow to occur.
- Provide no data about a User other than their Affiliation to the Institution. The status will be provided by the User’s Organisation at the point of verification and the accuracy of this information is outside VerifID Service Operators' responsibilities.
- Retain sufficient log information regarding each verification request.
