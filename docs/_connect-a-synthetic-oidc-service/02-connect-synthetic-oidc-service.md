Once you have clicked on 'OpenID Connect' on the [Connect a New Service](https://manager.test.aaf.edu.au/connected_services/new) page in Federation Manager, you will then be taken to the **Register a New Service** page.

Follow the [Connect an OIDC service](http://127.0.0.1:4000/connect-an-oidc-service/01-overview) tutorial to register your new OIDC service with the AAF Test Federation.
