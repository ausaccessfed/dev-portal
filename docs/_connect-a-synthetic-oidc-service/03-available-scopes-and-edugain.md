## Scopes

Once the AAF has provided you with access to the synthetic feature and you have registered your service in [Federation Manager](http://127.0.0.1:4000/find-your-registered-services/01-overview), click on your new active synthetic service:

![Services Page](/assets/images/connect-a-synthetic-oidc-service/synthetic-oidc-service.png)

On the service page, click on the "Scopes" tab to configure the scopes that your service will request from the AAF OpenID Provider.

Choose the scopes that you wish to use with your synthetic service. Please note that by default, *all* scopes will be used unless specified otherwise.
