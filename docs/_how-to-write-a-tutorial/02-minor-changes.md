## Raising an issue
The easiest way to request a change is to raise an issue. To do this, you will require a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

If there is an issue that needs to be resolved, please have a look through the [list of existing issues](https://github.com/ausaccessfed/dev-portal/issues) to see whether your issue hasn't already been reported.
If it has, or a closely related issue exists, please add your comments to the existing issue.

You can raise an issue by clicking on the ["Issues"](https://github.com/ausaccessfed/dev-portal/issues) tab in the AAF dev-portal repository and then clicking on the "New Issue" button.
