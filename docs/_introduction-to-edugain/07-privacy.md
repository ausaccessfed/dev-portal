### Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)

The Privacy Act 1988 includes 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) defined at:
<a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-act/australian-privacy-principles"> www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-act/australian-privacy-principles </a>

The APPs set out standards, rights and obligations for handling, holding, using, accessing and correcting personal
information (including sensitive information).

Service Providers can only use personal information for the purpose of delivering their service and may only disclose this
information to other parties in specific situations.

Key privacy principles subscribers should consider:
<ul class="list-group list-group">

    <li class="list-group-item"> APP 4 — Dealing with unsolicited personal information</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"> APP 6 — Use or disclosure of personal information</li>
</ul>
