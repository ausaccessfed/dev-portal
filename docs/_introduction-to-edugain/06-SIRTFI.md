## What is SIRTFI?
SIRTFI (Security Incident Response Trust Framework for Federated Identity) provides a lightweight framework to request and provide security incident response assistance, publish security incident contact information and review your serviceâ€™s security incident capability.

## Why does my organisation need to use SIRTFI?
SIRTFI is an important global framework covering good practice for communicating about security incidents in an effective and timely manner. SIRTFI helps security contacts know who to contact in other organisations and the best channels to use.
The SIRTFI framework is an initiative of REFEDS.

## Traffic Light Protocol
Organisations within the SIRTFI community agree to provide a coordinated response to security incidents, including assisting other organisations as required. SIRTFI requires organisations to understand and use the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) for security incident communications.
