* If you are using Keycloak for the first time, [please refer to their documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/documentation) to get started.
* Otherwise, if you are already using Keycloak on a container platform, log into the Keycloak admin console. In a local development environment, it is located at `http://localhost:8080/admin`.
